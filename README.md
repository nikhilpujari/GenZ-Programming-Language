# ZLang ðŸ”¥ðŸ’¯

> The programming language that hits different - built by Gen Z, for Gen Z!

ZLang is a complete programming language interpreter written entirely in Rust. It features Gen Z slang as keywords and provides a fun, modern approach to programming that feels natural to the TikTok generation.

## Features âœ¨

- **Pure Rust Implementation**: Built from scratch with no external parsing libraries
- **Gen Z Syntax**: Uses slang like `fr` (true), `cap` (false), `bet` (let), `sus` (if), etc.
- **Complete Language**: Variables, functions, control flow, loops, and more
- **REPL**: Interactive coding environment for quick experimentation
- **File Execution**: Run `.zlang` files directly
- **Helpful Error Messages**: Error messages that speak your language
